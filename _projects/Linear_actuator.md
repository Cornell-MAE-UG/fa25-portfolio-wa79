For a Statics assignment, I designed a linear actuator system within a 150 Ã— 50 cm 2D workspace, using only three joints (two grounded). From the provided catalog I selected the IMA55 actuator, rated for a maximum thrust of 8,050 lbf and a 45.7 cm stroke. The linkage was optimized to achieve a 50 cm lift using rotation-allowing pin joints. Based on hand static calculations, the mechanism can lift approximately 7,358 lbf to the 50 cm height.
