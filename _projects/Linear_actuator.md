One of my assignments for Statics was to design a linear actuator system. The constraints on this system include a 150 x 50 cm 2d space. We were limited to 3 joints (2 of which are grounded). We had to choose a linear actuator from a catalog provided. The goal was to lift the most weight at its max height. 

The actuator chosen (IMA55) produces a maximum thrust of 8050 lbs with a max stroke of 45.7 cm. The design was optimized for max height of 50 cm. The pins utilized were pins that allowed rotation. With basic static hand calcualations, I determined that the weight that the actuator lifts to 50cm is around 7357.82 lbs.
